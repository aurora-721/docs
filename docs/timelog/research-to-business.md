# From research to business

## Childhood
When I was young and they asked me what do I want to be I said **"I wanted to be an astronaut"**. Soon dreams fell short, when my cousin told me I was too tall to be one. As a small female child, having tall genes meant I was a head taller than all my 
classmates. After crying a bit, I thought about it and change my dream into being a scientist. "I will be the one who will send astronauts to space." This will be even cooler I thought since the astronauts are just the lab rats, the scientists are those that are making real decisions and discoveries.

I was a bit of a geeky kid growing up
 - started as a physicist

> Physics is a good framework for thinking. Boil things down to their fundamental truths and reason up from there.

 - went into electronics to be a researcher in the area of robotics
 - found out that research is more about writing papers 
 - went into business

> Having a breadth of knowledge in different areas allows you to create connections between different areas that you wouldn't see if you would just focus on one area of expertise.

> ~ Robert Greene

 - developed a growth mindset, you can learn anything, we are more similar than we think
> Intelligence is elastic, if you put your mind into it you can learn anything
