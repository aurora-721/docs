# From research to business

## Childhood
When I was young and they asked me what do I want to be I said **"I want to be an astronaut"**. Soon my dreams fell short, since my cousin came to me and told me I was too tall to be one. As child, having tall genes meant I was a head taller than all my classmates.

After crying a bit, I thought about it and change my dream into being a scientist. "I will be the one who will send astronauts to space." I thought to myself: "This will be even cooler, since the astronauts in the end are just the lab rats, scientists are those that are making in the end real decisions and discoveries.

I was a bit of a geeky kid growing up. I loved physics and mathematics, excelled at science competions, if I had a computer would probably spend my whole childhood there. However in retrospect, I am grateful for my parents pushing me to work on my athleticism through volleyball and gain an appreciation for music, through playing the trumpet.


## Studying Physics
At the time of choosing school I was indecisive between physics and computer science. Following the footsteps of my role model at the time Elon Musk.

I am increadibly grateful for the experience Physics has given me. There was met with an environment of people, who at the time seemed like geniouses. Being surrounded with a bunch of classmates, who all were previously at the top of their class, now being met with a reality check that there are people who are much smarter then them. There were no divisions between, people (you could even be a refridgereator and be respected) all that mattered was how smart you are (so smart smart refridgerator).

At the time I felt incredibly humbled and at times quite stupid. But after a while I learned maybe the most important lesson. That anyone can really learn anything. No matter what your background is. If people are smarter than you, I doesn't really mean much it just really means that they have a bunch of prerequisite knowledge that you don't really have yet.

 - developed a growth mindset, you can learn anything, we are more similar than we think

## Studying Electronics and researching Robotics
I switched my studies from Physics to Electronics, because one thing I really missed in the material I was learning was the practical application aspect of it.

Studying Electronics gave me also a bunch of free time, which I used to work part time as a robotics engineer in the Institute of Jozef Stefan. At the time they were working on a European funded project that aimed to move the progress of developing lower back exoskeletons. At the project I managed to created both the electronics and the machine learning algorithm that was used in predicting the motion of the human body. The exoskeleton that I worked on at the time was pretty simple in its workings. It was a passive exoskeleton, meaning that a levear had to be pulled when the human wearing it was bending down to pick something. By doing so the levear reduce the load on the back by 15% 

## Moving away from research
Unfortunately after gaining experience from working in different research departments I have learned that research is a lot of times not so much about innovation and creating a great product, but more about writing papers. Also have learned that evenualy when funding dries up, such projects end up collecting dust.
