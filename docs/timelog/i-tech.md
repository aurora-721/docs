# My time at Instrumentation Technologies
I started working in Instrumentation Technologies as a student and eventually ended up working there altogether for almost 2 years. 

Their core buisness is selling measurment devices for particle accelerators and their side business consists of creating technological solutions for industries on a project by project basis.

## Business solutions department
I started working at the solutions department of Instrumentation Technologies, where I worked on both electronics and low level programming writing programs both in C and Python.

We worked on several different projects, sometimes multiple in one day. I am very grateful for having had an amazing mentor, who taught me everything from fast prototyping on PCBs, to low level programming and networking. Some projects that I have worked on at that time included: 
 * creating frontend electronics for a water salination plant sensor
 * defining technical specifications for a military drone detecting camera
 * creating a website for the display of data aggregation and helping with the machine learning algorithm for the detection of vessels on the river Soca
 * as well as several other smaller projects

## Software development department
After a little less than a year working there I switched to the software development department, where I was working full time as a frontend developer. I managed to rewrite 80% of the existing frontend code base, building a frontend framework with extensive documentation. The aim of which was:
 * faster GUI creation
 * better code maintence 
 * easier addition of new functionalities
 
It served as the main user interface display for new users interacting with Instrumenation Techonology's measurment devices.
