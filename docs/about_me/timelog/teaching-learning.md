# Why learning is so important
The fact is that our schooling system hasn't changed much and it needs reform, a lot of it.

The quality of the schooling system should be uniform around the world. Your socio-economic background or geographic background, should not have any difference in the quality of education you receive.

### Why I chose to dive into education
 - I love learning and getting a bigger overview of subjects
 - I hate gated access to education, I want education to be available and accessible to all
 - I believe that in the following decades, education has a huge potential to be disrupted, because of the evolving fields in AI. The way great education is currently being taught does not scale well, thus bringing inequality of opportunity.

### My methodology
 - When teaching expect minimal prerequisites in terms of knowledge requirements
 - Even if people know a topic, they can forget it over time, therefore a revision of that topic is necessary
 - For every topic, you try to teach break down what are the prerequisites for you knowing that field
try to give a quick overview of the field at hand, go in many directions
 - Give analogies for a complex topic - people have a hard time grasping hard topics, easier

> Having a breadth of knowledge in different areas allows you to create connections between different areas that you wouldn't see if you would just focus on one area of expertise.

Learning any new subject should consist of:
 - Fundamental theory (in written and video form) - many resources, no memorization - memories about the subject at hand should be formed, by reading through more material, not by pure memorization
 - Working examples - coding exercises
 - Applied project work
 - Mentors you that can show you the path, but to whom you do not rely on to give you knowledge
